    <h2>A New Career Trajectory </h2>
    <p>For the last 5 years Jennifer has been a carpenter: however, a workplace injury 
        has required a change in career paths which has led her to
        the <strong>Computer Information Technology ( CIT )</strong> program at BCIT. At the age of 34 and many 
        years out of formal school, the learning curve for her area of studies has been steep.
        Prior to the return to school Jennifer used to enjoy socializing with friends, the great outdoors,
        and the simple things in life, like <em>sleep</em>! With a heavy course load Jennifers new hobbies include 
        <em>studying, more studying, and extra studying</em>. Even despite the lack of sleep and steep learning curve, she enjoys the classes 
        and recommends the program to anyone interested in an IT career. She hopes anyone interested in her program will
